::> network tcpdump start -node <node> -port e0a ?
  [[-address] <IP Address>]      IP Address 
  [ -buffer-size {1..2097151} ]  Buffer Size in KB
  [ -protocol-port {1..65535} ]  Protocol Port Number
  [ -file-size {1..65536} ]      Trace File Size in MB
  [ -rolling-traces {1..64} ]    Number of Rolling Trace Files
 
The - address option can specify only one IP address to filter the trace.
The -protocol-port option allows for the trace to be filtered by one port for both TCP and UDP traffic.
The -file-size option allows for modification of the trace file size from its default (1024 MB).
The -rolling-traces option specifies the number of traces files to save if using rolling packet traces.
If "-rolling-traces" is not used, a rolling trace with 2 files will be used.

!!  Ensure that node's root volume vol0 has enough space if you need to collect large trace files, you can use the df -h command to check it. !!
!!  Be aware that by default the trace files will be added to snapshot copies and that vol0 (root volume) may fill up very quickly causing an outage. !!
!!  To avoid that trace files will be included within snapshots perform below steps. !!
::> vol options vol0 nosnap=on. (automatic Snapshot copies is disabled)
You may consider to delete old snapshots for vol0 based on your space requirements. 
::> snap list vol0
::> snap delete vol0 snap name

Rolling trace example:
::> network tcpdump start -node <node> -port e0a -buffer-size 2097151 -file-size 512 -rolling-traces 4 -address 10.1.1.2 -protocol-port 445
 
This trace rolls up to 4 trace files of size 512 MB each (oldest file removed first). It uses a 4MB memory buffer, and traces on port e0a filtering for IP address 10.1.1.2 and TCP/UDP port 445.
 
To stop a packet trace:
::> tcpdump stop -node <node> -port [*|<port>]
 
To show packet trace files:
::> network tcpdump trace show
Packet traces are stored in the following path:
/mroot/etc/log/packet_traces
https://<cluster-mgmt-ip>/spi/<node_name>/etc/log/packet_traces

To delete old packet traces:
::> network tcpdump trace delete -node <node> -trace-file
   [-node] <nodename>         Node Name
   [-trace-file] <text>       Trace File
